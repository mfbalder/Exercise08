Because if so, then yes. Delicious. Challenge accepted. If I win, hamburgers stay on the menu. The rarest jewel of all: victory over me, Ron Swanson. I'm not planning to buy anything here. I buy all my hamburgers at Food and Stuff, a place equidistant from my home and work. I'm here for the same reason people go to zoos. I love Food and Stuff. It's where I buy all of my food. And most of my stuff. What exactly will you be cutting and how much of it and can I watch you do it while eating Pork Cracklins? What's a not gay way to ask him to go camping with me?

So does Baskin-Robbins. If you'd like to visit Europe, I like you so much, I'd be willing to risk it. Everyone is miserable. Tom can only work if there's someone to impress, so stranding him in Freak Island isn't helping anyone. You made April everyone's assistant. You know who April hates? Everyone. And Jerry can only perform when no one is looking. Shine a spotlight on him and he shrinks faster than an Eskimo's scrotum. Listen well, for I will not be saying this ever again: I have a compromise. Donna, you know as well as I do these city manager shakeups always peter out. You just have to wait. I'm Ron Swanson, and you're Leslie fuckin' Knope.
