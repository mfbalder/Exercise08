Fine. I'll be there soon. And if you get hungry, you can help yourself to anything in the fridge. And once I'm there, I'll determine how much to charge you. Hey, Ken. Isn't that a fun place to stand? Oh, I forgot to warn you about my dog, Tracy Sr. I trained him to hate white people. Because, not to profile, but most ghosts are white. This is my boy, here. And look what Angie did to him. She set up an invisible fence. He gets shocked if he tries to leave the property. Just because he'd run away and cause car accidents and impregnate neighbors' horses. He's trapped here, just like me. Maybe this will get Angie to stop calling me irresponsible. Just stay focused and take this sandwich to my wife. Nope, I'm in a strip club. My bad. Don't throw a party for vengeance. It will turn on you. Like your wife, after your kid has fallen into a quarry. I'm torn, K-Pax. I know I should be here, but my body's going to take me to Liz Lemon's. What do I do? Put the electric dog collar on me. You're going to pour glue in the lock. That's how my kids keep me out of the liquor cabinet. This better be ''meetment''. I'm importing. Yes, he probably picked up your scent and is hunting you. I suggest you cut off a finger and throw it in the river. Of course not. The Aryan hates and fears the African man, as we so clearly saw in the Blade movies. Splock... Short for ''Black Spock''. I had another freaky ''Kenmare''. [from the phone Dotcom's holding] Line! Let's do it again from the top. I want to get it perfect, because perfection is my middle name. "Unclaimed Perfection Baby Boy." Of course, friend. Teamwork is the key to success. No. I wasn't going to buy two blimps and crash them into each other to see what sound they made. Never better. I'm as happy as a clam who wants to kill some woman. [still to the tune of Billy Joel's Uptown Girl] That's too bad, but if I sing you cannot do anything to make me look bad on your TV show and also let me stay that Liz is a ho. A dirty ho. Five years ago I saved YOUR show! I rode in here on a white horse that you made me leave in the lobby. All you do is stifle me when you should be thanking me. And I have no reason to hug her other than my love of having boobs pressed against me. And I would anticipate your angling and I would get there. I would get there. No, you already said all on the show. You said it all! [hugging] I got there. That's the craziest thing I've ever heard. Episcopal. Do not mention the underwater city of Sironicon. Got it. Wow, I've always wanted one of these. The box would make a perfect coffin for my teddy bear. Congratulations. I am not interested in godfather duties. I'm sorry we were stressing you out. We shouldn't do that. It could turn your child into a Dracula. Why would you pretend to help Jack? Help him for real! It takes the same amount of time. You will be punished! Can I have my nunchuks back? I suck? The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame sucks. [Crowd booing] Hello. ''Purr-fect''! Like a cat birthday! How can I possibly get in trouble on a walking tour? I knew it! For a dude that has the most hilarious last name I've ever heard, you blow! We didn't land on Plymouth Rock! Plymouth Rock landed on Mars! Sure, find a scapegoat. Just like John Hancock did with the good King George. There you are! Your Kenneth and I were worried sick about you! No, I wouldn't. Not for a billion doll hairs. Yeah, they're not worth nothing. You could probably sell them to a doll company and get maybe $40,000 for them. Liz Lemon... you booger face! I'm going to kill you with a bazooka! No, It's off me! A book hasn't caused me this much trouble since Where's Waldo went to that barber pole factory. It's on you, Liz Lemon. And you will be punished. That's a pun on Amadeus, dummy. I will not be judged by you. You caused this whole folderol. And until you are adequately debased, you will subsidize my predilection for erotica. Oh, yeah. And I used your credit card to buy a vocabulary course from The Teaching Company. Oh sure! Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Paul Simon, Invictus. Uh oh. It's night time. Gotta go to bed or I'll anger the Gods. They must be crazy! Africa! Six, I knew it was a character from Blossom, but I couldn't find the ''Joey Russo'' button. I know it's a girl, Liz Lemon. Because I yelled, ''Susan B. Anthony'' at the moment of conception. We're going to name her after the place that she was conceived. It was a pretty wild night. So we're going to name her either Virginia, NetJet, or Bathroom at Teterboro Airport. Uh-huh. And before you worked here, were you an ass scientist? Because your ass... blah-blah-blah. You get the point. I blame you three for my unhealthy attitude towards women! You have created an atmosphere of hostility and intolerance that everyone talks about all the time! Grizz, when was the last time you told your fiancee you love her? Since the phone call I interrupted to make this announcement! Kenneth, your haircut is disrespectful to lesbians. Verdukianism? That doesn't make sense. Jimmy is Catholic. New dude is as good at singing as Tracy Jordan is at everything. Why don't Catholics eat meat on Fridays? I'll tell you why. Because the Pope owns Long John Silvers. Uh-oh, Ken. We may have fallen into the intellectual deep end here. And if you try to grab onto me, we'll both drown. Come over here and check out my corner. No trap. Come over here, I said. In my normal tone of voice. Liz Lemon, recently, I realized that I have a hole in my heart. And not the one I got from eating batteries. It's 'cause I don't have a daughter. I'm glad you feel that way. Because Angie's on her way up, and I want you to tell her for me. Oh, yes, you are. Click. I said ''click'' to distract you from the sound of the handcuffs. You did good. There was a better kid's birthday party up the street. Your hair did? You just got your hair did. You have to get your hair did again? Racist. Yes, perfect. What's that? I want it. I forgot why I originally came in here. Sure, I know him from the secret black people meetings. Nah, I'm just kidding. He's not invited. But who's ''EGOT''? No need. I got something better than presents for you and the kids. I got us all this ''EGOT'' necklace for me. I am going to EGOT. For us. For the family. And especially for little Chewbaquina Jordan. Great, I'll be in touch. You still using your Hotmail account? I'd first like to thank my creative team for coming in on such short notice. And I'm sorry I'm four hours late. Dotcom, research update. Is it me, or is Liz Lemon getting hotter? As a time saver I will refer to the two of you as Clemen. I wanted that next level, Clemen. Now remember, to save time, you two are Clemen. It's a combination of- I'm sorry I did this to you, half a Clemen. I had no choice. Sean Penn wanted me to go to Haiti with him and I'm not strong enough for the pain and the human misery of a three hour plane ride with Sean Penn. I'm tried of hiding. I just want my old life back. It's not a leash! It's a very long skin tag! Jesus was black! Here come the roofies. Why don't you shut your mouth, back that ass up, and make me a sandwich. I lied to all you ugly white ladies. I didn't go to Africa. I was hiding in a warehouse in Queens watching vintage pornography. No! It's un-brave! You should hate me! What does that even mean!? F.U.L.L. spells "full," because you're full of B.S., Liz Lemon. I am a Jedi! There are tears falling on her boobies, Liz Lemon. I know you've been molested. That's how we all got here. But I don't want to hear about it. But I wasn't even supposed to say that! The line was "Sherinne, I hope Dr. Mugutu has good news about my endoscopy," but I couldn't get it right so they told me to improv! That's crazy! A man named Elia. That's a giraffe's name. You know how on St. Bart's, people be eating their lobsters like this? [Eating sounds] Don't look at me in the eyes! Right on, my brother. My dear friend, Moby, opened up a tea house in Park Slope. Does he know you? Hey, Rolly. You ever lose your remote control? And then your wife starts getting all mad because the roof won't close and the bed that's in the shape of your face is getting rained on? I like you, Rolly. Can I feel the rough skin on your hands? Hello, fellow human being. would you like to ask me what time it is? Are you a large child or a small adult? You look regular. Can I guess your name? Is it Pedro? Is it Craigford? Is it Swimming? Are you a pre-op transcentaur? Excuse me. Do you have change for a $10,000 bill? I would like some chicken nuggets, a beer, and some of my wife's rice, to stay. Excuse me, sir. Do you want to hold hands with a black millionaire? Does anyone want to be my friend? I'm normal! It's going super great, Dotcom. Meet my new friends, ''Nobody'', and his wife, ''Susan walters-Hyphen-Nobody''. I'm so far from my roots, I don't think I'll ever get back. what's that sound? Bucket drummers! These... these are my people! Bucket drummers, if you are striking, so am I. Two, four, six, eight, 10, 1 2, 14, 16, 18. New what? If it's a blonde woman, I'm going to kill myself! This is going to be the scariest Princeton Parents' Weekend ever! Boo! So how are you feeling? Any arm pain? Shortness of breath? Plans to investigate corruption in Russia? Oh, yeah, I forgot, Dotcom. You know everything about acting because you played a bird in some stupid school play. If i start screaming in my sleep do NOT wake me up. I will attack you. [starts snoring] YAAAAA! WAKE ME UP! FREE FROM THIS! [snores] LAAAAHHHH HA! The party hasn't started. That's just the guys setting up. Can I borrow a cup of sugar? I'm trying to get a hummingbird to drink out of my penis. Fore! Hey guys! It's me, Tracy! The black guy from work. I hooked the ball onto a truck on the Long Island Expressway, and Tracy Jordan does not take mulligans. Good thing you had to move out of that house. Some idiot rammed his boat that I was driving into it. Great impression of a guy that sucks, Dotcom! Look, we got a lot of work to catch up on. Was Dotcom standing that gay? It was either that or play a rapping doorman in a Kate Hudson movie. [laughs] I get it now! It's so funny! Everyone laugh! NOW, you sons of bitches! Don't ever tell me what to do! Quad hug me in the middle! Also, due to a paperwork mix up, you will not be getting paid this month! Always have been, always will be. That's what Danny was saying. We have to be cool to everybody. Because the future is like a Japanese game show. You have no idea what's going on. It's ''Take Your Black Kid to Work Day''. The Cosby Show lied to me. That's why my life is not like The Cosby Show. I only have boys. And boys are disgusting! I need a baby girl. Don't patronize me! Stop laughing! It's not funny! I need a baby girl! Don't slit my vas deferens! Wake up, Tracy! Wake up! I don't want a vasectomy, Dr. Spaceman. I need to go back in time. Why did I sell my DeLorean to Mr. T? Well, I hope he makes me an across helmet so I don't get hurt playing across. Now come on. That's pretty solid for a guy who just came out of a hallucination. Yo, Lemon ! You coming to the after-after-after party?! Let's blow this joint! lt's about to turn back into a taxi dispatch set-up. You going to the after-after-after-after party?! Well, let's rock! Don't go, Liz Lemon ! There's still an after-after- after-after-after party! l just got to take my kids to soccer first! Hey, whose roof is this? ''Tom Cruise,'' 'cause that's how Oprah says it. ''To-o-o-o-o-m !'' What can l do? l'm on my grind. l'm gonna have so much money my grandkids are gonna play lacrosse. Lacrosse, Liz Lemon. No I'm not. I took a Real Age Test that said I'm dead. Pay attention to me LL or else I'm going to do something self-destructive. For example, I just got an honorary sheriff's badge and I'm going to start making real arrests. Why not? The Bronx turned me dyslexic. [voicemail message] Hi, this is Tracy's cell phone. Dot Com, hold the steering wheel, I gotta leave my outgoing message. What'd I just hit? Was that a person? Is that paint or blood? Dot Com, this did not happen! We take this to our graves! I will make a brief statement on behalf of the idiot community, then I will open the floor for questions. Since its founding early this afternoon, the National Association for Zero Intolerance, or NAZI … We should change that. My ringtone is the chicken dance. If I answer it, I won't hear the whole song! I want you to call my phone so I can hear the chicken dance again. Hang on, have you not left this building since you were mugged?

Hang on. Why do you have a cat? And a fanny pack? And your ponytail... it's being held up by a chip clip! Because I'm upset! Also I've been taking these new Czechoslovakian organ-slimming pills. They contain a little bit of meth. Which is something my body needs anyway! Listen, I'm not going to let you wallow like this. I am taking you out so you can rebound. Sexually. Now, when I'm rebounding I like to do it with an NBA player because, well it's fun word play and... they're mean. I don't know, it used to be a factory or something. I always knew this would end someday. I just thought it would be with me in the trunk of a rental car. Doug is my vibrator. This isn't a relationship. This is some woman who shows up every couple of years to ask for money. To her, I'm just a gorgeous, naturally blonde A.T.M. Jack, it was perfect. Like a John Mayer song. Hi, I was told I'd get paid if I came here and danced while the Atlanta Hawks eat dinner? My mom just made them, so they still might have some pigeon mites. But she said those can't ''affect-affect humans-humans''. Hey, Liz. Verna's coming back for Mother's Day. We're going to do a duet of ''I'll Make Love To You'' at a children's hospital. Well, I only wear designer labels. These are Jamie Foxx for Assfarm. Wait... what? I was making my thing up. You bitch. Getting stuck with new cast members who don't even hit on us once. Wonderful news, non-famouses! My publicist just called from rehab - I made the Internet. How do I find me? [to the computer] COMPUTER. JENNA. [slaps Liz] What is that?! [points at Abby] [flashback to Jenna and Liz at a bar surrounded by admiring guys, with Jenna making baby noises] Uhhh goo gaa! There can't be two of us, Liz. She must be destroyed. So you're saying it's a choice. Between the dignity of middle age and the illusion of youth. Hang on, I'm just tweeting that I ran into you. This is so tandem. Oh, not me! I can hear it! Ugh, my ears are, like, dying! Ah, Facebook! ♪ Forever young I want to be forever young ♪ Thank you, Liz. It's funny. All my ''a-ha'' moments end with a moustache pressed against me. Don't cry for me, Tartine. I've had a full life. Oh, the things I've seen. The first Clinton administration. The Nagano Olympics. Microsoft Windows '95. But I'm 41 now. Time to die. This is actually a werewolf picture that, for tax reasons, is shooting in Iceland. I play a moon scientist who's trying to get to the bottom of things and who- spoiler alert- may herself be a werewolf. we start shooting tonight. Punish you? Please, Liz, I've just always wanted to shoot a student werewolf movie in Iceland where I'm filling in last minute for Victoria Beckham. And you probably don't know this because you've never played a moonologist, but werewolves only come out at night. Oh, great day, everyone. You guys are the real stars. Yes, Nightstalkers is taking a brief permanent hiatus. Oh, Liz, thank you for giving me the hotter porn lady. [subtitle: Jenna, Former Child Star] Am I trying to instigate fights by throwing wine at people just to get on camera? And maybe also promote my new lifestyle website, Jennas-Side.com? Of course now. I mean, is wine throwing something that even gets on you a reality show? [cut to Portia throwing wine in D'Fwan's face] [cut to Angie, D'Fwan, and Randi throwing wine in each other's faces] [cut to Randi in a limo throwing wine in a German Shepard's face] Jennas-side. Jennas-side. I'm not hearing it, Liz. [tips Jennas-Side.com cap at the camera] C'mon Portia, I don't want to fight. Drunk actor brainstorm: I'm going to make Pete host an intervention for me. It'll be all about Jenna. Drama, crying, the beauty of redemption. Perhaps a song. This is the best day of my life. Does chewing on a sponge trick your brain's hunger center? Yes, yes! A million times, yes! James and I just had lunch at the Spotted Pig. The paparazzi were everywhere. The gossip blogs are calling us ''James''. It's a combination of ''Jenna'' and ''James''. Oh, Liz, I am happy. All this attention, getting my picture taken, having ice-cold diarrhea from drinking too much Jamba Juice. It's everything I ever wanted. Yes, because I'm so happy for you. It's definitely not a rage stroke. My niece drew a picture of me, and I look so fat! Thank you. But you don't know what it looks like. Because of the door! Okay, don't try to move the body yourself. Oh, no, why did you do that? Jack, you don't know what it's like to be on ''ca-mer-rah''. You're vulnerable. You're exposed. You're exposed. It doesn't take a lot to send you over the edge. Not anymore. You've created two Lizzes. Regular Liz and Performer Liz. You've got to lie to her. Coddle her. Protect her from the real world. Jack, I just got your business ''sext''. What have you done? Of course not. I'm not wearing my outfit. Listen up, fives, a ten is speaking. As you may have heard, the Jenna Baby dolls I was selling on QVC have been recalled. Apparently they were just being used to smuggle cocaine into the country from Mexico. And that's caused some problems. Me, my ass double, and a drill that once appeared on Home Improvement are currently starring in a feature film called Take My Hand. I met that soccer ball once at a no-hands-allowed sex party.

Oh, eat it. Conrad Bain once slapped me in a men's room. It works, Liz. Look at me. Ever since I started secreting I've become a TV star, I've found my soul mate, you saw how flat Gwyneth Paltrow sang at the Oscars. I visualized all of that. Oh I've taken action. It dries your mouth out but the sex is amazing. Last year I used The Secret to learn Spanish and now I'm fluent. [enunciating carefully] "Rosa. I know you stole my necklace. I'll have your son deported. Oh wait, I found my necklace." It depends. Do you have access to horse semen? Do you like it? If you say no I'll drown myself.

And if you make me do the dishes, I will kill myself! But, Kenneth, I need all of these. This one is for my cell phone. This one is for my laptop. This one is for my erotic massager. And this one is for something personal. Well, of course not. Drama is like gay man Gatorade. It replenishes their electrolytes. Hey, how did everything go with Dotcom? Why do you do this to yourself? lf you don't like him, end it. Who cares if he thinks you're a racist? Yeah, we're all models west of the Allegheny. Liz, you don’t understand, people look at me differently now--Jack, the writers, the manager at Forever 21. Jason, have you ever put out a cigar on Gilbert Gottfried's neck? Because I have, and his screams were the worst thing I'd ever heard ... until tonight. Congratulations, you're a disgrace. Amazing news, Liz. I made the 'People' magazine crossword! One Across, five letters, Jenna Maroney's first name. Because of 'America's Kidz Got Singing' I am blowing up. When you google "Jenna Maroney" now, I come up first, not the Jenna Maroney who electrocuted all those horses. I couldn't find a Lincoln hat, so I grabbed this chimney sweep hat instead. Leeches. They're good for your skin, and I've lost tons of blood weight. Liz, if I become famous, will you tell me if I start acting weird? Demi Moore does it, plus it makes PETA furious. And if PETA doesn't love you or hate you, you're a nobody, like a soldier or a teacher. Oh, I owe him a call. I bet he's going to tell me I can't write off all my shoplifting.

I was rollerskating in the house, which was absolutely forbidden. I was skating down the hallway, on top of the world, with my new skates and my new haircut, which everybody thought was a Dorothy Hamill, but was actually a Pete Rose. Anyway, I needed to go to the bathroom, but the door was locked. My recently divorced aunt had moved in with us and I was sharing a bathroom with her. To be prepared I tried to take my underpants off over my roller skates. I slipped, and as I fell I pulled down this poster of the singer Tom Jones that my aunt had put up. My mom heard the noise and ran and found me... squirming under the Tom Jones poster with my... underpants around my ankles. It didn't look good, Jack. She thought I did it on purpose. And she didn't say a word. She just went in my room and took all my posters. Grizzly Adams, Larry Wilcox, Han Solo, Tug McGraw, Mike Schmidt, Kermit, Gunther Gebel-Williams... She took all the people away, Jack! Sex makes the people go away!Liz  [flashback 3] ...and one time at summer camp I kissed a girl on a dare, but then she drowned.Liz  Not really. I was going to take this class called "Cooking For One," but the teacher killed himself.Liz  Oh. Okay. Great! Fine. I'll solve my own problems. [tries to open door] [finally gets it] Blammo. Solved it.Liz  Well when you put it like that, with the mean voice and all...Liz  [gasps] Albino ninja!Liz  Work husband slash uncle.Liz  [shows Jack her leg]Liz  Joanne. Okay. Well I look forward to visiting her and her wife... on their farm.Liz  Jacqueline? Like named after you, like a little Jack but with boobs?Liz  [glasses crooked] Hi! I'm Daphne Donaghy! I saw a turtle!Liz  Kylie. Great. She can strip her way through community college. C'mon.Liz  Uh huh. So you're putting one more nut job -- yeah, I said it -- one MORE -- I'm political -- in Washington so you can advance your career? What is going on today? Has everyone lost their moral compass?Liz  Technically I am a freelancer, which is pretty much a modern day cowboy. And I live like a cowboy by buying quality, locally-made jeans. Also by eating beans out of a can. Due to impatience. You're on your own here, partner. But hey, it's not all bad. Because you get to watch me walk away. [walks away]Liz  What is this, Jabba's pleasure skiff?Liz  Oh, you stay there. You stay there until you die.Liz  Also, the next time I see someone throwing a football in here, there will be fines. And... if I see that filthy dog again, I will put it down. I will put it down with a smile.Liz  When I didn't get it my dad blamed Santa Claus. Well, Santa made an enemy that day. The next year when he returned to the Schuylkill Galleria, so did vengeance.Liz  [flashback] [Young Liz] What does it matter? You didn't bring me what I asked for last year you fat fraud. You're a bigger disappointment than our current president, Jimmy Carter.Liz  I have this recurring dream... Actually is it recurring if you wake yourself up with a [snorts] and then return to it? Anyway, in the dream I'm a baby but my parents left me on the top of the car by accident...Liz  I think it has to do with my issues with sex.Liz  Well.... kind of?Liz  [in bad Japanese accent] Damn you, Godzilla! [pronounced god-zihr-ra]Liz  I mean, what did Colleen say when you knew about your real dad. [gasps] You never told her about Milton, either! I am the Mental-Liz!Liz  I'm not Rick! [watches a transvestite that looks uncannily like her skate away]Liz  You know what I learned tonight? As hard as you try, no one can escape the horror of Christmas, so it might as well be with your own family. I'm going to go get a bus to White Haven now, and I should be home just in time for Aunt Linda to try to prove that she's sober by holding someone's baby while cooking.Liz  So I'm gonna to marry... Yafet. And we're going to live in... Nineva. And I'm going to be a.... prostitute. Okay, what else? What else?Liz  You know there isn't.Liz  If I have to sit through that alone, I will rent a car, set it on fire, and drive it off a waterfall.Liz  Okay, friend, here's the deal. My name is Liz. I almost got 1200 on my S.A.T.s. And I need a date for this wedding. And I like your head shape.Liz  Is that a fraternity?Liz  There it is.

I am ''innoventing''. A word that I just ''innovented''.  N.B.C. It's fresh.  And I think we can both conclude that we finished Q-one with better than expected results. And I can promise that my performance will improve, especially if you're a little more flexible on your end.  You look like a prison weed dealer.  Well, I'm glad you're trying. But I wish you didn't have to. Lemon, are you wearing a cup?  Lemon, I am successful romantically because I am confident, open, and positive. You are negative, pessimistic, and in danger of becoming permanently sour.  Typical liberal media. That's why I get all my news from Dick Cheney's website, dickviews.com.  I'm no stranger to the art of japery. At Princeton, I was in a secret society. I shouldn't tell you this, but one time, we snuck up to Dartmouth, put their mascot in a box, and sent it to Mexico City. We didn't know until the next day that it was an actual Indian. He didn't speak a word of English. Like all Dartmouth men.  They're Boston Irish Catholic. They mate for life, like swans. Like drunk, angry swans.  Reality TV. A woman with hundruplets, a live execution, the Real Transvestite Hoarders of Orange County Penitentiary.  [applauds with Jonathan and crew] Fantastic, Jenna. You really brought the songwriting computer's words to life.  Haven't we? Operation "Righteous Cowboy Lightning" is a go.  It was reality TV. It can be good, it can be terrible, it just can't be anything in between.  I'd like to welcome everyone to this N.B.C. Employee Town Hall Meeting and thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules.  Before I take your questions, I'd like to say a few words about Don Geiss. The world has lost a giant. He built G.E. into the greatest company on Earth and the Earth into one of the top three planets in the universe. For those of you wishing to pay your respects, there will be an Episcopal cryogenic freezing service open to all Six Sigma black belts and higher.  So, Dave, tell me all about KableTown. What's their business strategy? Revenue streams? Do they have a preferred side of the head for parting your hair? Because I've been Continental for years, but I'm willing to go Western.  I'm going to bury Don Geiss, America and hope.  Welcome all to the memorial service / freezing for Donald H. Geiss. You were the last of a dying breed, sir. I'll never forget the first thing he ever said to me. ''These are all hookers. Pick one.'' Then after we picked our hookers and the plane took off, he told me his business philosophy. There's always an untapped market. Don was the one who realized there was a whole segment of consumers not buying light bulbs. The asleep. That realization led him to develop the nightlight and the marketing campaign aimed at making children afraid of the dark. ''A monster under every bed.''  Don said that no business is ever done evolving. That there are always opportunities for innovation. That you can always... You can always find new customers. I... I'm sorry. But I've just had an amazing business idea. You'll have to excuse me.  Exactly. So what if women had a pay-per-view channel featuring handsome men patiently listening to them? What if they had... porn for women?  Hear me out. Yes, I'm talking about doubling pay-per-view profits while cutting out the middle man. But I'm also talking about American businessmen doing what they were born to do. Make things. We've stopped making and become a country of consumers. Well, I, for one, am done consuming. And I'm ready to make.  Distancing myself? That man is my mentor. He taught me how to command a room with my voice.  You're going to Nags Head? Isn't that redundant?  [opens envelope and reads letter] "You're going to Nags Head? Isn't that redundant?" [hands Liz an envelope]  Avery and I are also having a little romantic weekend together. Before the baby comes we're going to Toronto for the G8 Economic Summit. It's going to be... very erotic.  Have a nice trip, Lemon. Break out those underpants, but be careful: dating yourself is a double-edged sword. It means you also share the same flaws.  Not only is your fly open, there's a pencil sticking out of it.  Good God! She'll be Canadian.  I called the concierge service with my Amex Invisible Card. There are no rental cars. The trains and buses are sold out.  Look, Avery. You and I are cut from the same cloth. It's one of the reasons we work so well, and why we're unbeatable at a three-legged race.  Avery, maybe it isn't the end of the world if our daughter is Canadian. Alexander Hamilton was born in the West Indies, and he went on to-  Yes, my daughter is Canadian-American, but I'm going to treat her just like a human baby. We tried to get back home, Lemon, in a meth lab. Avery and I fed each other's craziness, but one of us was brave enough to step back-  Avery, can you walk yet?  Let's go find a Canadian who will take our money.  It's complicated. These women run your household so you have to keep them happy which means not saying anything as your DVR fills up with Trinidadian soap operas. But as soon as I'm out of the woods, Lemon, I'll take care of this... latest... dysfunction.  I'm not saying that what you do isn't important. Avery and I appreciate you and Liddy just adores you, but let's just say you're at the market buying potatoes, and that ten pound bag of potatoes costs... four hundred dollars. But then the... grocery concierge tells you that a five pound bag of potatoes costs four hundred dollars, well that would be shocking, right? Because a five pound bag should only cost two hundred dollars.  Meanwhile I just got worked over by my Trinidadian night nurse. I made every mistake you can in a negotiation. I spoke first, I smiles, I negotiated with myself. If I had done that during a mock negotiation in business school, Professor Widmer would have spanked me in front of the whole class. Bare bottomed.  Sherry! Excellent. I've been thinking about our conversation earlier. It occurs to me that you are laboring under a fatal misapprehension. You think you have leverage over me, but you don't. I don't care about the baby. I've only known her for a few weeks and other than a fondness for Avery's breasts, Liddy and I have nothing in common. She is one of two people ever to have thrown up on me and I haven't spoken to Joe Namath since that Mardi Gras. What's more, I don't think Liddy looks like me, so evolutionarily that makes me want to eat her. In other words, either you take a pay cut or go and look for another job. Who has the leverage now, Sherry? Your move.  Every day we give you a hundred dollars for cab fare home. Do you realize what you're doing to me, Sherry? You're unravelling the very fabric of who I am. I negotiate for a living, and I never lose. And now I have to go negotiate with my colleagues at Kabletown after having been reamed by a woman wearing Winnie the Pooh hospital pants. I don't have what you have, Sherry. A brand new baby that they've poured time and money and love into. Some helpless, pathetic, useless thing that would die if left alo- Oh God, I do have that. I have NBC!  Home run, Lemon. And speaking of baseball metaphors I see that someone got to first base which is what I consider sex with a stranger.  [flashback to Jack's office] [TV has bullet points: Star Wars, Fried Food, Bagging on Movies, Malarkey] It's white wine, ice cubes, and Sprite. She calls it "funky juice."  I've got to look camera ready tonight. I'm being interviewed on C.N.B.C. Have you ever watched The Hot Box with Avery Jessup?  Wow, that is inspired. You are truly the Picasso of loneliness.  Of course. You know, I learned to talk to gorillas when I worked for G.E. Medical. We are going to test poisons on you.  It's set to Geneva time. Last night, Avery saw right through my conference call move. Today, she sent this. ''Hopefully, you won't make the same mistake again, 'mon se poivre That means ''my salt and pepper'' in Swiss French.  What? No, people do not change. In the late 90s, I thought Colleen had become a better person. It turns out she had a tumor pressing on her brain's pleasure center. A tumor those quack doctors removed.  Nancy, I'm sorry, the audio's bad. Jonathan, why do I have an Indian assistant if my computer is always...  Well, that will really disappoint your key demographic of drunken 11-year-olds.  Then find someone else. I recommend Lutz. Why do I always want to choke that guy?  Have another open house. I bet someone offers cash this time.  Female jealousy is an evolutionary fact, Lemon. If you try to breed it out of them you end up with a lesbian with hip dysplasia.  Lemon, who thinks gesturing with one's thumbs is for poor people is going to be the next CEO of Kabletown? [points to himself with his pinkies] This guy.  Nothing. She wants to be a marine biologist. Kaylie is playing right into my hands. I also had a youthful fascination with exploration, and I know exactly what any fourteen year old science geek wants to do: practice frottage on a poster of Linda Ronstadt and meet your idol, like when I met Jacques Cousteau. I will never forget what he said to me. [pause] Ah, I did forget. It was so long ago.  [opens envelope and pulls out collage-card reading: Thanks for the expedition to the museum! Love, Kaylie] This could be me. "Remember Jack Donaghy? He was the world's greatest oceanographer. And we walruses owe him everything for giving us the gift of language."  It's a younger man's game, Lemon. But I can't say that I don't miss it. You'd be in your office late at night, and the new girl would come in with some flimsy excuse to be there. ''Oh, Mr. Donaghy, I forgot to give you the factory worker death rates.'' Then, she'd laugh at your lame joke. A touch on the arm. And you'd take your reward. You'd take your reward.  Nothing, really? That's too bad. 'Cause you know what I always say. Black light attack!  Well, I had a Porterhouse for Two alone. I am very angry and sleepy.  This badge is a symbol of dignity, honor, and dramatized 1970s inter-ethnic California daytime motorcycle highway justice.  If you were a man, you would have to register yourself as a sex criminal. I'm taking Danny back.  It's true. It was love at first sight. I ache for her sexually. How could I not? I'm entranced by those... mud-colored eyes, set back in that skin. And her laugh. Her walk. That splay-footed walk. And that... whole situation. Right there. And Oh... Moustache. Good God, Lemon.  ''Lemon numbers among my employees.''  Yes and no. Yes, that did happen. No, it didn't not happen.  Bzz... Laser shield.  This isn't the auto industry, Pete. The auto industry was run by a bunch of out-of-touch white guys selling consumers a product they didn't want. we're G.E., damn it. And we're going to make a giant, flimsy microwave.  ''Four, get it.'' Four smaller doors.  Okay, it's a car. we've invented the Pontiac Aztek.  Shh... You know how the media are. They wait for a mistake and that's all you are. It happened to Hitler. No one ever talks about his paintings.  When we were on the DL we spent most of our time in the whirlpool getting rubbed down.  Switch hitter. Pitcher. Catcher. Whatever the boys needed.  [subtitle: Jack, Tracy's Gay Boss] I think I made my point.  I know. I broke it. I needed to speak with you and I knew that was the fastest way to get you up here.  Lemon. Lemon! Is there any news about Tracy?  TWINKS could be extremely lucrative. Advertisers covet this demographic. When I was with D'Fwan on Queen of Jordan he spent four thousand on chihuahua outfits. For himself.  Thank you, Lemon. I'd like to help but I'm afraid My Hands Are Tied... is the only show anyone's watching on TWINKS.  Oh! Of course. Liddy, she is adorable. My night nurse swears she calls me "coschelle," which is Trinidadian creole means "stranger."  Devon. Explain the gaybies.  No. You are the spider. I am the sun. I dry up all the rain.  You bastard.  Oh, what have I done? The woman is on vacation with her husband as we speak. Probably having beach sex. Which is the third best sex after elevator and White House.  Good Lord, I've ''Lemoned'' this situation with Nancy. I've got to erase that message.  Are they? Nancy Donovan. Still so organized. In German class, Mr. Kruger always chose her to sort the students. He was eventually arrested by Israeli commandos. Mm. Look. On the 30th, she took Flight 1470 to R.S.W. He left the next day for C.V.G. They have to be different cities.  The company has acquired an up-and-coming social networking site called YouFace. So each executive has to set up their YouFace page. Now this picture will be my ''PhoLo''.  I've been finger tagged, Lemon.  But only because my mother told me that French kissing was for the Italians.  Weird in a good way, huh. Like going to the gym drunk.  There's a lot of history in Studio 4-C. To Catch A Predator, The X.F.L. Halftime Show, storage for broken copier equipment. And now Dealbreakers.  Yes, well, it's really happening for you, Lemon. Between T.G.S. and this, you're like a swarthy, big-hipped Kelly Ripa.  I knew it. You're blonde in your fantasies. It looks terrible.  Lemon, that is why Dealbreakers is going to work. Because your star is a crazy person. And my star is you.  I.M. Adouche? Banks! What do you want?  No, I knew right away.  Well, I don't know, are you married? I'm just saying.  Great, now we're perfect. What if we changed your name to Veronica St. Pierre? No, that's too much. Your hair is fine.  No, It's Liz. I need Dealbreakers to work. And yesterday, I told her that she shouldn't wear her glasses.  I get it. Treat her like The New York Times treats its readers.  This is great. You look really relaxed. I'd watch this show.  No, no hi-def. Uh... because of the camera. The, uh, ''gobos'' are really ''moraying''. Right, Pete?  Okay, here is the honest truth. You're better at this than Oprah.  I didn't say I wasn't going to see it. Lemon, what is it going to take to get you out of there? What do you want?  Lemon, I am hemorrhaging money right now.  Your audience has spent the last hour listening to Kenneth tell cleaned up versions of Garrison Keillor stories.  Now I understand Performer Liz is freaking out. So I need Regular Liz's help.  Lemon, I need Regular Liz to tell that crazy bitch, Performer Liz, to get out on stage and give me something I can try to make money off of. Please.  Lemon, what have we done to you? It's okay. Go home and get some rest. I'll take the hit.  ''Whom''. And from now on, whenever a television is on in the background of a Sheinhardt-Universal soap opera, you will be on it.  Do you know what the business model works in the entertainment industry? Make ten shows and hope that one of them works. We produce more failed pilots than the French air force.  Congratulations. According to the transitive property you just defeated Muammar Gaddafi in arm wrestling.  I'm an eleven, but continue.  Did you make sure that Tracy wasn't pretending to be his own wax figure at Madame Tussauds?  Uh, we'll start with ''going country''. To T.G.S. we'll trick those race-car-loving wideloads into watching your lefty, homoerotic propaganda hour yet.  Right, Josh, I forgot about that guy. You think that's a good sign?  So naturally, you came to me because this company is just the two of us.  I didn't lie, Kenneth. I massaged the truth. what do you need to move past this?  Now, remind me. Did you just do the Philadelphia cotillion, or did you also debut internationally?  Canada? Why not just go to Iraq? The television audience doesn't want your elitist, East Coast, alternative, intellectual, left-wing...  I have to apologize. You know what they should do with people like her? They should round them all up and put them on an island. Oh, wait, they already have. It's called Manhattan.  I'd never been to an audition before. It was upsetting. A grotesque carnival of human misery.  I had the perfect woman. Gorgeous, brilliant, always let me be the hat in Monopoly. Why is this happening to me? God, are you punishing me because my hair is better than yours?  Liddy, say "good God, Lemon."  Uh, Liddy and I just went to Strawberry Fields where she spat up on a white lady's dreads. It's nice to see that we're back to our version of normal.  No. Call back tomorrow. She has babynomics at eleven.  Maybe someday you'll be like me, running a billion dollar corporation, having people pay you for the privilege of cutting your hair, raising a child.  Not really. Avery's been travelling a lot as part of NBC News's "Hot Blondes in Weird Places" initiative, so she's been out of the baby loop. Until Liddy is sleep trained, frankly it might be easier if Avery stays in Asia.  Are you accusing me of not doing enough Reagan time with her?  President inter-Bush is out of the question. Avery will never accept his help. She can't forgive him for not hitting on her during the 1996 Democratic convention.  I do, of course, have some connections, but my best bet is fraught. I never should have broken up with Condi via text message.  Me plus you equals frowny face.  That's okay. She's tough. We do a lot of pirate-themed sexual role play. I'm a parrot.  I'm sorry that I broke up with you by text. I'm sorry I went drinking with Karl Rove on Valentine's Day. I'm sorry that I said your favourite movie was lame.  C'mon, Avery, not now. I am going to get you out of there. You are married to Jack Donaghy, dammit, and the world doesn't get to do this to us. WE control our fates! WE are in charge! [pause] Avery? Are you still there? I'm sure her battery died. Right after I finished that speech, just like I wanted it to.  No we aren't. I was wrong. Condi tried, but Avery plus freedom equals... frowny face.  I don't think there are. Welcome aboard... Danny.  Two questions. Must I live by Superman's moral code? And will the sex woman get older?  I know this sounds ugly, but with Manhattan real estate, there are no rules. It's like check-in at an Italian airport.  You're preaching to the choir, Kenneth. I mean, I love the earth. I have these rare Kadupul blossoms flown in every morning from Sri Lanka on a private jet. That's the definition of green. And yet, they force us to do more. More sacrifices. Why? For the children. What have children ever done for us?  Damn you, Tracy Jr.  Ah, it was for a couple of lousy months. Big deal. l had sex with your prom date.  When l think of all the things that l've been holding inside me that l wanted to say to you ! Well, now l'm gonna let St. Patrick and St. Michael do my talking for me!  Those are the stupidest fist names l've ever heard.  Well, this would have proved my mother wrong, saying that ''Donaghy'' is Gaelic for ''failure.'' What the hell does she know? She's a Murphy -- bunch of mud farmers and sheep rapists.  Remarkable people, the Blacks -- musical, very athletic, not very good swimmers. Again, l'm talking about the family. Black is African-American, though.  Well, l know that is the type of thing we tell ourselves, but, trust me, when l was dating Condoleezza, there were genuine cultural tensions. l mean, we would go to the movies, and she would yell at the screen.  Ghostface, you think you could mention donaghyestates.com at any point?  Who told Tracy about anagrams? l'm gonna call Dr. Spaceman.  Uh, take off that jacket. If you're not wearing one of those Christmas sweaters out of guilt, I'll give you $1000.  This thing's a real cash cow, unlike 'Cash Cow', the failed NBC spin-off of 'Cash Cab'. You try riding a cow through mid-town Manhattan, Lemon. The animal will panic.  I'm in your head.  Well I have to go get a bunch of gaybies into preschool before we all get sued so uh … well done, Lemon.  We'll see. Our new slogan: "NBC: We have a magical horse" is testing, uh … OK.  Lemon, I'm sorry, but Jenna has become a huge star for this network. She's bigger than Maulik Pancholy on 'Whitney'.  I was in Washington yesterday, reviewing satellite images of Avery in North Korea. For what it's worth, CIA analysts have confirmed that she is indeed "keeping it tight". Lutz Lutz Lutz Lutz Lutz Lutz Lutz Lutz LutzLutzLutzLutzLutzLutzLutzLutzLutzLutzLutzLutz Dr. Spaceman   I'm also listed under meth addiction and child psychiatry. So, what can I help you with? I should start by saying that I can't personally help you conceive. Something happened to me while scuba diving. Dr. Spaceman   Say no more. If it's giving people meat, then I'm on board. I've always said Humans need more animal blood. It keeps the spine straight. Dr. Spaceman   You boys need anything while you're here? Some reds? Yellows? Just got some purples in from Peru. Dr. Spaceman   And it's healthy. Hi, I'm Dr. Leo Spaceman. I'm a working physician with a degree from the Ho Chi Minh city School of medicine. Dr. Spaceman   [Jack coughs] And cough. [Jack coughs again]. And cough [Jack coughs again]. Okay! Now, let's start the examination. Dr. Spaceman   Have I given you my new book? [He holds out a book titled "You're Doing It Wrong!"] It's about having a satisfying love life. For life! Dr. Spaceman   My techniques guarantee male orgasm. Dr. Spaceman   Ladies! What? This? No, no. I was at a costume party earlier this evening and the hostess's dog attacked me, so I had to stab it. Jack's going to be fine. But he has had a pretty serious cardiac episode. Also, I suspect he may have scurvy because he keeps asking for lemon. Dr. Spaceman   Good morning! Now, full disclosure: most of my experience is putting babies IN women.Dr. Spaceman   You just described my morning. Now, Mrs. Jordan, I've already administered the epidural, so... would you like one as well?Dr. Spaceman   Erectile dysfunction. It's not just a dog problem anymore. It also effects millions of men. I'm "Doctor" Leo Spaceman. For too long, erectile dysfunction has been viewed as a physical problem, and it's been treated with pills and ointments and contraptions whose straps break all too easily. But couldn't the real cause of E.D. be that we haven't produced a good "doing it" song since "Close The Door" by Teddy Pendergrass? That's why I recorded an album.Dr. Spaceman   [singing] Baby, let's take it slow. You know we've got all night, light some candles, draw a bath, and start off with full-on intercourse.Dr. Spaceman   Guaranteed to end erectile dysfunction, these are the sweet sounds of Dr. Leo Spaceman's "Love Storm." An ultra-strength audio re-boneulator.Dr. Spaceman   One more ''peow'' and... donezies.Dr. Spaceman   I'm sure it did. This machine is a genuine... LASIG? Hm, curious. Here. Can you read the top line over there?Dr. Spaceman   Well, why not? So frustrating. But at least I heard it from a friend. So while we're here, what else do you want to do? Face burn? Bone morph? Mouth peel?Dr. Spaceman   Really? I think you mean radio.Dr. Spaceman   You seem nervous. I could give you something for that. Ah, but you know what? I'm not supposed to have sex with my patients.Dr. Spaceman   Excellent. [sees Pete off] My God, Jenna, are you pregnant? How? Did you go swimming in a public pool?Dr. Spaceman   Well that's redundant. All pregnancies are hysterical. They're started by penises.Dr. Spaceman   All right, now that the popsicle's melted we've got ourselves a tongue depressor.Dr. Spaceman   Ah they're nothing to be ashamed of. I get them from prostitutes.Dr. Spaceman   Sounds like you could use a little R&R. Rum and Ritalin.Dr. Spaceman   There are four things I want to do this summer, but they're roommates so it's tricky. All right, here's a prescription for your cold sores and here's a blank one for the weekend. Now one final thing. Why aren't you wearing pants?Dr. Spaceman   Other doctor? That's my brother Randy. Tomorrow he's going to jail for the rest of his life. Good one, Randy! Hey you want to go to Taco Bell for lunch?Dr. Spaceman   If a patient's friend runs into the operating room and yells at you, you have to stop. It's the Doctor's Code. Kenneth   I promise, I'll do better, Mr. Hornberger. Kenneth   Good morning Mr. Donaghy. Kenneth   My mother always told me that even when things seem bad, there's someone else who's having a worse day. Like being stung by a bee. Or getting a splinter. Or being chained to a wall in someone's sex dungeon. Kenneth   My mother is my best friend. Kenneth   My mother has her dark times too, but that's when i say "momma you carried me for 9 months. let me carry you now" Kenneth   I know a gentleman who had a lot of crazy ideas. He was a carpenter. He wanted everyone to love one another. Kenneth   Well, don't let it happen again. Are you ready for an exciting and challenging day? Kenneth   No that's usually how it goes. Kenneth   Well, I like to start cleaning in one corner and then work my way across the room in a zigzag.Kenneth   You said I'm your boss for today, so I fire you.Kenneth   See you tomorrow Mr. O’Brien.Kenneth   No, you shouldn't. please, think of your children.Kenneth   Um, but I need to --Kenneth   Oh yeah? If I blew it, then how did I get her underpants?Kenneth   I just don’t want to disgrace the peacock.Kenneth   Pregnant cornbread!Kenneth   Mrs. Jordan? Oh, I don't --Kenneth   They confused shim with Mrs. Jordan -- Yes, ma'am.Kenneth   [ Guffaws ]Kenneth   Especially after l picked out all these throw pillows for in here, and you didn't even notice!Kenneth   Oh I dunno ma'am. [heavy accent] You made me think about and when I gets to thinkin bout it, it just gets worse!Kenneth   Oh, Miss Maroney, I have your messages. Uh, a Mr. Bret Fav-ray stopped by, and uh, dropped off this picture of a hot dog? There you go.Kenneth   Heh heh. Oh, uh, and the Chilean miners are all out, and they are very angry about what you've been saying about them.Kenneth   Heh.. If you need someone to scream at, I'm right here.Kenneth   [claps politely]Kenneth   Ha ho, I'm sorry. It's just that... Mr. Lutz is wearing a hilarious t-shirt, and every time I see him -- just look! [points to Lutz wearing an "I'm With Stupid" t-shirt] [laughs] Whoever's standing next to him is stupid! That guy is stupid. [Lutz starts walking] Now she is, and now they are. Now I were! [laughs] Anyway, Mr. Donaghy called while you were with Mr. Jordan. He needs to see you right away. [goes back to his Page desk, laughing]Kenneth   Lying perfectly still reminds me of hiding under our porch during a Hill People rampage.Kenneth   Ah. What are you tinkering with, sir? You know my uncle was a tinkerer. Until the FBI shot him.Kenneth   Miss Lemon, there's a reason God gave us two ears and only one mouth. Listening is twice as important as talking. But he gave us ten fingers. He must really want us to poke things! Ahhhh poke! [pokes Liz] Poke poke poke poke! [leaves, poking writers]Kenneth   [hears Liz through a dreamy haze as he writes "Harold" over and over on his notepad]Kenneth   I'm not done, sir. It gets worse. With Harold gone there was nothing keeping me at home. It was time for me to move to New York and follow my dreams, but I needed $300 for the river ferry-train-oxcart-train-bus ticket. And that's when I saw the sign.Kenneth   It was Harold. And I ate all of him. Even the face in case of a tie.Kenneth   I ate him, sir! I ate my father-pig! [screams]Kenneth   But comedy is just as important as drama. People need to laugh, especially in these tough times. And after all, isn't laughter the best medicine? Except for insulin, Spironolactone, and Bupropion, which I have for you whenever you're ready, sir.Kenneth   [gives thumbs up to Tracy]Kenneth   They want me to get a promotion, but I don't wanna move to Los Angeles.Kenneth   Good afternoon and welcome. Not. We begin our stupid tour of this once-great network outside Studio 6-H. Uh-oh. Ring, ring. Hmm. What's up? Nothing. Just giving a dumb tour to a bunch of uggos.Kenneth   Let's meet up later and smoke some drug cigarettes.Kenneth   No, no! For four long years, I have listened to you all complain about your East Coast Media Elite problems. Your apartment renovations and your overpriced Star Wars memorabilia.Kenneth   Good luck, Argus. Well, sir, there's nothing wrong with this bird. He's just very old. Argus probably doesn't have very long to live.Kenneth   Well, not ''New York thin,'' but... Don't worry, I'm on it, Miss Lemon. Sorry. Mrs. Argus.Kenneth   Oh, no, I get that. What I don't get is this is Danny's dressing room.Kenneth   Mr. Donaghy... I have to run out to Mr. Jordan's house. I'll call you when I get there so you know I'm safe.Kenneth   Actually, sir... I think you should come home. Mrs. Jordan said she's going to turn her rings around if she sees me again. She wants you to come help her.Kenneth   You're a good husband, Mr. Jordan. [Dog growling] Sir, is there any chance your dog followed me here?Kenneth   Gosh, Mr. Hornberger. you say that so often, you should come up with a shortcut word for it, like ''Ivatrennaprah''.Kenneth   Now I don't have a lot of experience reading stuff out loud to people, so I'm going to do this the most normal way I can think of. ''Space, space, space, space, space, space''. ''My Autobiography. ''Space, space, space, space, space. ''By Kenneth Ellen Parcell. ''Space, space, space, space, space.''Kenneth   Oh, I'll show you how to thank me.Kenneth   What happens when the second flood comes and you're not allowed on Reverend Gary's ark? Especially since Reverend Gary made it clear the ark is just for teen aged boys.Kenneth   I can talk to animals. Well, not TALK to them, but take commands from them.Kenneth   Look at all these books, sir. I feel like I'm back at school, learning about the dangers of book reading.Kenneth   Including meeting the man of your dreams? Oh, Miss Lemon, it's so romantic. Just like that movie I only saw the first 10 minutes of- Fatal Attraction.Kenneth   You're going Irish!Kenneth   Not what my uncles does when he gets a hitchhiker over a barrel, I'll tell you that.Kenneth   Isn't that just "Easter?" And I don't want anything, sir. I'm just happy to spend all day here helping my work family.Kenneth   [very slowly] One... Mississippi...Kenneth   [flashback to Kenneth poisoning Donna's food with a green powder out of a false ring]Kenneth   Sorry I'm late, Mr. Hornberger. Funny story. There was a guy on the subway who I thought for a second didn't have any fingers. But then I realized, he was holding his hand like this.Kenneth   Oh, I've got an idea for a show called Doctor, about Richard Doctor, who's a piano player. Do you remember that show, Jennifer Slept Here? Ann Jillian plays the ghost of a Hollywood starlet who helps teenagers. With what? I don't know.Kenneth   Some of those people on Match Game were drunk. With power.Kenneth   Did you know the Today Show used to have a monkey on it? Hasn't been as good since. I think that chimp used to drive the truck himself on You Know What and The BearKenneth   Miss Lemon, these gentlemen are the writers for Bruins Beat, whose offices we'll be sharing. They're all named Sean, they are mean, and I hate it here.Kenneth   I hope my legacy is a Sesame Street-type TV show that promotes illiteracy in girls.Kenneth   I'm sorry, did you say, ''doll hairs''?Kenneth   [subtitle: Kenneth, Elderly Page] Mr. D'Fwan, Party City does not sell giant see-through clocks or Pegasus wings, so I got this paper pineapple instead.Kenneth   Miss Maroney, your addiction has negatively affected me in the following ways: Number one, I was so worried I forgot to write the rest of this letter. Thank you.Kenneth   Starting a fan mailing campaign to save the show. People will send sugar cubes to Hank Hooper to show that they're sweet on TGS. I've already sent about a hundred of these even though licking an envelope is a sin. Unless you're married to it. So I had to marry each envelope and then divorce it, which brings me to my ninth point-Kenneth   Kenneth, you beautiful goon! He's not in Africa! He's somewhere in the delivery zone of Federici's Pizza! We can find him and bring him back here and no more forced hiatus!Kenneth   Bird Internet...Kenneth   Sorry, sir. That happens sometimes when I unhinge my pelvis.Kenneth   Sir, this computer is not helping with our search. If you type ''Nancy's Secrets'' into the internet, do you have any idea what comes up? A store that sells wig extensions.Kenneth   Uh, Fort Myers and Cincinnati. Did you not learn your nation's airport codes in high school?Kenneth   The sun is up, and we are still in these people's home. God can see us now. We have to find that voicemail code.Kenneth   It's not the numbers, sir. It's the letters. They spell ''Klaus''. Your name in German class. The class you were in with Nancy. In high school. Back in Massachu...Kenneth   And a bowl of meat cubes with picture of Jimmy Connors sticking out, in the tradition of Verdukianism.Kenneth   Not me, sir. Tonight is the Verdukian Holiday of Mouth Pleasures. Misters Rossitano, Spurlock and Lutz must have free sausage pizza followed by some gentle flossing performed by a blond virgin.Kenneth   Yes ma'am. There have been several deliveries to this address of Mr. Jordan's signature order: large cheese pizza with one slice taken out so I can pretend I'm eating Pac-Man, like my hero Blinky the ghost.Kenneth   Hello! I'm a baby!Kenneth   Mr. Jordan, I refuse to accept this is happening. You leaving is as crazy to me as evolution or a woman's right to choose her haircut.Kenneth   Sir, I have a problem with my time card.Kenneth   Oh, It's not the money, sir. It's just that I always work more than 16 hours, so I would be signing my name to a lie. The Parcell name is synonymous with honesty. As the Hill People say, ''Parcell gaw say del go up de saw say.''Kenneth   All those zeros. It's downright un-American.Kenneth   Of course, sir. would you like something to eat? I have some leftover turtle meat from dinner. Or as you would call it, ''bonus'' turtle meat.Kenneth   well, there's a bar in the shower that the previous tenant installed to keep from slipping. He still died in there, though.Kenneth   Those glasses are for display only.Kenneth   Sir, you sound like the mall Santas when they come back from lunch.Kenneth   No, sir, he passed away. But at least he died doing what he loved. Blogging on the Huffington Post.Kenneth   Pity? Oh, sir. Back in Stone Mountain people lose their spouses all the time. Mumps, hill people attacks, cave collapses -- both business and residential -- continuing my list...Kenneth   When someone needs help you don't waste time feeling sorry for them. We help them. And you seem like you could use a home-cooked meal.Kenneth   It's an old Parcell family recipe, but I look to replace the Union soldier meat with boiled potatoes.Kenneth   Well I have to work. Now that the crew is gone I like to give everything a good spring cleaning, starting in the bathroom. There's a lot of drawings of Miss Maroney eating celery that men are giving to her with their hips.Kenneth   Thanks for the heads up, Jonathan. Do you want to come to my birthday party?Kenneth   I don't like to swear, sir, but no thank you! Now, maybe I haven't had a wife who was kidnapped, but I have seen the Brady Bunch where Tiger runs away. We've all been through some bad stuff, Mr. Donaghy.Kenneth   [watching from a distant rock, with a telescope] You see all the good that is in them? How much capacity for love? Yes, I know. I just need more time with them. Give more time, Jacob! I BEG OF YOU! [title: TO BE CONTINUED]Kenneth   Is it menial?Kenneth   Global warming, sir? I'm sorry, that's just a bunch of scientist talk. Same people who'd have you believe that my great grandfather was a monkey. If he was a monkey, then why was he killed by a monkey?Kenneth   I'll do it if you insist, sir. But I'm going to be grumpy until the end of this sentence.Kenneth   Well, let's see. Minka Kelly says, ''My show is about football. There is a football team called the Chargers. Unplug your chargers.''Kenneth   Miss Lemon, your mini-fridge is still in your office. You made a promise to Masi Oka. ''Conserve electricity. Don't be a zero. Be a good guy.'' Why doesn't that say ''hero''? That feels like a real missed opportunity. Dotcom Dotcom Dotcom Dotcom Dotcom Dotcom Dotcom Dotcom DotcomDotcom
